i have created this by using flask and mongodb if you want to run it you have to edit its aws creditials and gmail account for email verfications by the admin user 
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

then just write flask run on your terminal thank you
